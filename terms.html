        <div class="summary-box">
            <p><strong>In brief:</strong> Nomology is a recipe discovery app. These terms explain the rules for using it. The key points: we provide recipe inspiration, not professional advice; AI-generated content should be reviewed before use; subscriptions auto-renew; and we're governed by English law.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>1. Agreement to terms</h2>
        <p>By creating an account or using Nomology, you agree to these Terms of Service and our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>. If you don't agree, please don't use the app.</p>

        <p>Some features require a paid subscription. We may add, modify, or remove features at any time.</p>

        <h2>3. Your account</h2>

        <h3>Cancellation</h3>

        <h2>5. Acceptable use</h2>
        <p>You agree to use Nomology lawfully and respectfully. You must not use the service to violate any laws or regulations, infringe anyone's intellectual property rights, harass, abuse, or harm others, distribute spam, malware, or harmful content, attempt to gain unauthorised access to our systems, or use automated tools to scrape or extract data from the service.</p>
        <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts that violate these terms.</p>

        <h2>6. User content</h2>

        <h3>Your content</h3>
        <p>You retain ownership of content you create in Nomology, such as recipes, notes, and collections. By using the service, you grant us a licence to store, display, and process your content as necessary to provide the service.</p>

        <h3>Shared content</h3>
        <p>If you share content within a Circle, other members of that Circle will be able to view it. You are responsible for ensuring you have the right to share any content you post.</p>

        <h3>Content removal</h3>
        <p>We may remove content that violates these terms or that we reasonably believe is harmful or illegal.</p>

        <h2>7. Circles (social features)</h2>
        <p>Circles allow you to share meal planning with family, friends, or household members. By creating or joining a Circle, you agree that your display name will be visible to other members of the Circle, content you share within the Circle will be visible to other members, and you will respect other members and not share inappropriate content.</p>
        <p>Circle owners can remove members at any time. Members can leave a Circle at any time. If you are removed from or leave a Circle, you will no longer have access to content shared within it.</p>

        <h2>8. AI-generated content</h2>

        <div class="warning-box">
            <p><strong>Important:</strong> AI features are provided for inspiration and convenience. AI-generated recipes and suggestions may contain errors. Always review AI-generated content before use, especially ingredient lists, cooking times, and temperatures.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>How AI features work</h3>
        <p>Nomology uses artificial intelligence to parse recipes from text or URLs, suggest modifications to recipes based on your preferences, and generate images for recipes. These features use third-party AI services (see our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> for details).</p>

        <h3>Limitations</h3>
        <p>AI-generated content may be inaccurate, incomplete, or unsuitable. AI may introduce ingredients not present in original recipes. Cooking times and temperatures may be incorrect. We do not guarantee that AI outputs are safe, accurate, or appropriate for your needs.</p>

        <h3>Your responsibility</h3>
        <p>You are responsible for reviewing any AI-generated content before using it. This includes checking all ingredients (especially if you have dietary restrictions or exclusions), verifying cooking times and temperatures, and using your own judgement about food safety.</p>

        <h2>9. Food safety and ingredient exclusions</h2>

        <div class="warning-box">
            <p><strong>Nomology is not a substitute for professional medical or dietary advice.</strong></p>
        </div>

        <h3>Ingredient exclusions</h3>
        <p>Nomology allows you to exclude ingredients from your recommendations. This feature is designed to help filter recipes based on your preferences, but it has limitations.</p>
        <p>Our ingredient database, including tracking of allergens in compound ingredients, is maintained on a best-effort basis. We cannot guarantee complete identification of all ingredients or allergens in recipes, that recipes from external sources are accurately labelled, that AI-generated recipes correctly exclude all unwanted ingredients, or detection of cross-contamination risks ("may contain" warnings).</p>

        <h3>If you have allergies or medical dietary requirements</h3>
        <p>If you have food allergies or medical dietary requirements, you should always read ingredient labels on packaged foods, verify ingredients with original recipe sources, exercise the same caution as when trying any unfamiliar food, and consult healthcare professionals for allergy management.</p>
        <p>Nomology's exclusion features are an aid, not a guarantee. You remain responsible for ensuring the food you prepare is safe for you to eat.</p>

        <h2>10. Intellectual property</h2>

        <h3>Our content</h3>
        <p>Nomology, including its design, features, and original content, is owned by us and protected by intellectual property laws. You may not copy, modify, or distribute our content without permission.</p>

        <h3>Recipe content</h3>
        <p>Many recipes in Nomology come from third-party sources. We link to original sources where available. Copyright in those recipes belongs to their respective owners.</p>

        <h3>Feedback</h3>
        <p>If you provide feedback or suggestions about Nomology, we may use them without obligation to you.</p>

        <h2>11. Service availability</h2>
        <p>We aim to keep Nomology available and working well, but we cannot guarantee uninterrupted service. We may need to suspend the service for maintenance, updates, or due to circumstances beyond our control.</p>
        <p>We do not guarantee that the service will be available at all times, error-free, or free of viruses or other harmful components. We may discontinue the service or any features at any time with reasonable notice.</p>

        <h2>12. Limitation of liability</h2>
        <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law:</p>
        <p>We provide Nomology "as is" without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied. We are not liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from your use of the service. Our total liability to you for any claims arising from these terms or your use of the service is limited to the amount you have paid us in the 12 months before the claim arose (or £100 if you have not paid us anything).</p>
        <p>Nothing in these terms excludes or limits our liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence, fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation, or any other liability that cannot be excluded by law.</p>

        <h3>Food safety</h3>
        <p>We are not liable for any illness, injury, or other harm resulting from food you prepare using recipes or information from Nomology. You are responsible for ensuring food safety when cooking.</p>

        <h2>13. Termination</h2>

        <h3>By you</h3>
        <p>You can stop using Nomology at any time. To delete your account, use the account deletion option in the app settings or contact <a href="mailto:support@nomology.food">support@nomology.food</a>.</p>

        <h3>By us</h3>
        <p>We may suspend or terminate your account if you violate these terms, if we are required to do so by law, or if we discontinue the service. Where possible, we will give you notice before terminating your account.</p>

        <h3>Effect of termination</h3>
        <p>On termination, your right to use the service ends. Provisions of these terms that should survive termination (such as limitations of liability) will continue to apply.</p>

        <h2>14. Changes to these terms</h2>
        <p>We may update these terms from time to time. If we make significant changes, we will notify you through the app or by email before the changes take effect. Your continued use of Nomology after changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the new terms.</p>

        <h2>15. Governing law and disputes</h2>
        <p>These terms are governed by the laws of England and Wales. Any disputes arising from these terms or your use of Nomology will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales.</p>
        <p>If you are a consumer, this does not affect any mandatory consumer protection rights you may have under the laws of your country of residence.</p>

        <h2>16. General</h2>
        <p>If any part of these terms is found to be unenforceable, the remaining parts will continue to apply. Our failure to enforce any part of these terms does not waive our right to do so later. These terms, together with our Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding Nomology.</p>

        <h2>17. Contact us</h2>
        <p>If you have questions about these terms, please contact us:</p>
